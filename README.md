##Prepare the http-server

# http-server: a command-line http server

# Installing http-server globally:

Installation via `npm`:

     npm install http-server -g

This will install `http-server` globally so that it may be run from the command line.


## rum the application:

Go into the folder and type:

     http-server ./ 


*Now you can visit http://localhost:8080 to view your application



##Notes: 
The application will access the REST server in http://209.239.124.224:8080/movieapp

Go to Main Menu and search the movie you want to seed or create a new.

At the Form Movie page(clicking in the 'Create a new Movie'), the user can upload a poster for the movie.


In case of the local application do not run , try access  http://209.239.124.224:8080/movieapp

This is how the application will load in a SPA with js and css code minified.
